<p> Jonah.. Your name is Jonah..you don't know the real reason why you ended up with that name (you always wanted to know)..Your father whose name is Jordan, tells you he wanted your name to rhyme with his..You believe him at face value..The real reason you ended up being Jonah though, has everything to do with the circumstances under which you were born.</p>

<p>Your mother, in her hey days was the de&nbsp;facto Miss (insert any beauty pageant). She belonged in a glass frame, somewhere on the walls where all valuable possessions are hanged to be admired. Boys in your generation would say "she hawwtt!" (you find that dumb).</p>

<p>Your father on the other hand, was the village snob ( by consensus). Of course, he didn't think so (they all never think so)..he believed that he was ahead of his time, he belonged to a different world (prolly because he held a master's degree in philosophy from the University of London, he was the only one with such academic credentials at the time). While his "intellectual" and academic prowess was heads above shoulders, the same couldn't be said about his bank balance and social acclaim (he didn't care much for both and this baffled everyone, your mother exclusive). The more the village folk repelled him, the more your mother was drawn in. She found him and his endless " theorizing" unique, refreshing and quite interesting.</p>

<p>Theirs (your papa and mama) was a thrilling love affair ( while it lasted). Public display of affection was a taboo in your village, your parents re-wrote that particular&nbsp; rule. They would kiss in the middle of the road because, well ,people kiss. Your father would carry your mother on his back like a three year old. Onlookers secretly envied them and publicly showed disgust of them. Your mother would bring it up in conversation, she would often tell your dad how the village folk felt about their romance, he would ask her everytime if she enjoyed their moments together, with a sheepish smile she would answer "Every bit" to which he would say "Your opinion is all that matters baby".</p>

<p>The baby at some point was always going to have to have a baby (you, not your mom). She, missed her period..she didn't know how to react to that. She knew your father's opinion on procreation (that is how he referred to it not the usual " giving birth or producing like other mortals). Your mum too, wanted a baby but not at that time when you came. She broke the news (is it me, or does anyone else find that phrase so odd "BreAKinG nEWs" fuck it) to your dad who obviously was unimpressed (not that many things impressed him anyway).</p>

<p> He said something that nobody really remembers, but it got your mom so worked up that at that point she knew she was going to have you for the whole purpose of pissing your father off!&nbsp; You were born out of protest, your father the one who enjoyed his practical jokes, named you Jonah after the Biblical Jonathan (he couldn't tell whether Jonah was a prophet or just a preacher but he knew enough that somewhere in his story he had disobeyed God, and God being God had shown him who God was..). Your father accepted you in his life the same way Jonah eventually gave heed to God's request and went to Nineveh.</p>

<p>You were brought into your father's life a month after you were born (Your mom had disappeared from both the village and your father's life soon after "the argument"...)<br>A heavy sleeper, your cries awakened him on the random morning when he found you at his doorstep with a few clothes, a milk bottle and a note that showed birthday (how thoughtful of her). Your father chose the day on which you now celebrate&nbsp; your birthday, he ignored the date on the note with which you were brought. He picked you, fed and washed you..the first of many more times to come.</p>

<p>He'd been depressed (he would never admit it to himself) ever since your mum left, he barely had any physical contact with anyone. Like clock work, for the past month he'd followed the same exact routine, he'd wake up and be ready just in time to attend his class (he was a lecturer), In class, he didn't even bother getting the names of his students, he treated his students as lab rats for his experiments, this is the only activity that got him out of his bed for the most time..that too started boring him.. For many a time, he flirted with the idea of suicide..he was glad he hadn't gone through with it later in life when he saw you ride a bicycle for the first time. He grew so fond of you. He loved you.. something against his beliefs (studying philosophy does that to you if you take it up for the wrong reasons)</p>

<p>Your presence changed all of that, he now had a reason to get out of bed every morning, he noted the day you developed your first tooth, he took you to school eventually (he'd hoped he would home-school you, but like your mum, you were a ball of energy and so strong willed that he had to let go of that fantasy, you were just unbearable, a handful). He was always there to get you from school, he helped you with your homework, when puberty struck, he explained to you what a "period" was. He was the reason you aced your literature classes without breaking a sweat..he made you read to him and after analyzed the books with him..he taught you to see through the authors bullshit (you liked how he said that in husky voice). On your eighteenth birthday, the two of you traveled to Paris (to date, you wonder where he got the money for the trip but you're thankful for the gesture anyway). While in Paris, he told you what to expect from boys..he told to always follow your gut. You held onto every word he said, to you..the gospel could go and fuck itself, who needed it for the truth when you had your father's word..you knew he always had your back.</p>

<p>That is why fast forward, you married for money and not for love. You always knew it was easier to learn to love or live with a person you didn't love if you could get the finer things in life. The alternative didn't strike you as pleasant as the novels and movies made it seem. You followed your gut or maybe your father's advise (at some point they were the same thing to you). You got married to a hot shot lawyer who had limited time for you. You liked it that way..you had time for yourself. You had long decided to become a writer (your father glorified them, naturally you wanted to please him). Your marriage was perfect for that (before you gave birth). You got your first child, a girl, she kept you occupied for the first three years..your life rotated around her's..</p>

<p>They always grow up first, she started school at 3..you missed her for half the day when she was in school but you always made up for lost time whenever she came back. You always looked up to the time she left school, that is why some days you would collect her from school yourself and let the maid who usually did off to go and use her free time on whatever it is she used it for..you didn't care as long as she did her chores in time.</p>

<p>On such evenings, you got to your baby's school 30 minutes before they were yet to be released from school..you sat in your car lost in thought..it is then that it dawned on you that you were bored or just unhappy with your routine,your life in general. You couldn't even tell the difference but you figured something had to change..You made mental notes of the various activities you could pick up on..yoga sounded to you like auditions to stripping gigs, you canceled that. ...salsa classes..you wondered who even does that.. you've always found dancing&nbsp; a useless indulgence..you quickly crossed that off the list.. somehow you convinced yourself that you didn't have to zero on what to do just yet..but you were happy with yourself that atleast you knew you had a problem and that way you would try and solve it .</p>

<p>Your thoughts are interrupted by&nbsp; your munchkin (you chuckle on the thought of referring to her that way..you didn't call her a bundle of joy atleast..that would never have gone well with your father which means it doesn't go well will you either) on the door of your car.<br>You go through the greetings and that's that..she doesn't talk much just like her father (you like that about both of them, you hate their hyper activity..where they lack in words they over compensate with too much activity). Today she lets you be, she might also be dealing with her own internal crisis but you are sure it can't be worse than what you're going through..I mean some kid might have refused to eat crayons as she'd suggested and she is sulking for that..you let her deal with it, that is how they get grow up anyway..you tell yourself.</p>

<p>You take a different route home, you go through town (you rarely do that)..on impulse you stop by what is supposed to be a popular fast food chain outlet (you don't know it's name, not until you enter it, it doesn't qualify to be popular if it were up to you).<br>You buy chicken and fries, you don't even fancy the meal but anything random at that point is more than welcome. You look around and observe people (your father taught you that, you developed a little game out of it, .you imagine what all the people there might be going through in life depending on their dress code, posture, gait.. anything works with your game) .That is how you notice a young lad, he could be 27..he has neat little dreadlocks (that is why you picked him for a 27 year old, he is independent ,on the road of self actualization usually telling society to shove it's finger far up its body where the sun doesn't shine). He has a laptop on his table but he is ignoring it..occasionally glancing at his phone and looking at the entrance like he is expecting someone.. You watch yourself join him on his table ..you objected to this at first..but then convinced yourself..you were here for a change. So you went and sat at his table (you would always go away whenever you wanted..besides your daughters would come get you whenever she got bored with the game on your tablet..she usually did).. You asked him about who he was waiting for..he inattentively answered back..an associate.. On a different day you would have left. You never tolerated assholes..today was different. You continued prodding..it was actually fun (any change.. really)..You asked him what he did for a living. He said he was a developer, a programmer. You wandered what the the difference was if any..you didn't ask though. .. you had been taken up by the cuteness of his nails that made up so much for his non aligned teeth..&nbsp;in fact..had  you had a gang of girls..you would have formed a WhatsApp group just for the sole purpose of telling them about how cute that guy's nails were!. Of course they would digress and talk about how big their own men's genitals were, bragged about their sexual prowess (the men)..you wouldn't have given a rat's ass..they just hadn't seen those damn nails.. </p>

<p>Anyhow..you come back in time..indulge in chit chat with this somewhat shy guy but clearly knows his stuff.. you even realize he is funny..he could as well have pursued a career in comedy.. he would be better than half the guys who were already practicing..you wonder if that is even an objective call or you are just smitten..you don't think long enough about that.. because..it honestly doesn't matter. .</p>

<p>The next few days are the best days of your adult life .You never get around to shagging this young nerd with cute dreads and non -aligned teeth.. but the steamy texts the two of you exchange during the day and even at night while you lay beside your husband are just enough to arouse you.. they bring intense anticipation of what might happen between the two of you..good times these ones..</p>

<p>What you don't know,  in a few days. . .on a  Monday morning.. you will hear your phone ring..you will guess who is calling. He is the only one who ever calls at such odd times because he has nothing much else going on in his life apart from his job. . You'll rush butt naked to go pick up the phone..but you'll slip and hit your head hard on the side of the bathtub.. you'll never wake up from that..your daughter will be the first to find you in the evening when she comes back to school..she will be confused due the fact that you'll be lying there unresponsive..yet you could be helping her with her homework. She will call the maid..who in turn will call your husband. ..your youthful lover who had called earlier..would never find out that you breathed your last rushing to pick up his phone&nbsp;call. He&nbsp;will assume you grew bored of his immaturity and chose to call it off..</p>

<p>In case you are wondering how I know all this.. I'm the spirit of your mother that has been watching over you silently ever since I died while giving birth to you... just seconds before I made my sister who doubled as the midwife  in a dark lit room swear to deliver you to your father..I named you Jane..your father went with Jonah! </p>
